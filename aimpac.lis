                    DESCRIPTION OF THE AIMPAC PROGRAMS

(Please see the .man files for a more detailed description of the programs)


EXT94b.SRC   -The program EXT94b is used to locate and classify the 
               critical points in electron density (rho), Laplacian of rho,
	       Lagrangian Kinetic energy density, Hamiltonian Kinetic
	       energy density, nuclear potential and the virial field.
	       The program also computes various properties at these points.

PROAIMV.SRC   - PROAIMV calculates average properties of an atom by 
               numerical integration of the appropriate density over 
               the basin of the atom. This is a vectorized version of
	       old PROAIM program. In this new program the atomic surfaces
	       can be determined by two different methods: which are labelled  
	       PROAIM and PROMEGA. PROAIM will handle the majority of cases.
	       In certain situations, difficulties are encountered in
	       specifying the atomic surfaces and then PROMEGA must be used.
               In  PROMEGA the atomic surfaces are located by determining
	       where on a ray (from the nucleus of interest) the gradient
	       paths passing through the ray change attractors.  This
	       procedure bypasses many of the problems associated with the 
	       surface routines used in PROAIM. No knowledge or use of
	       critical points is required as the surface is found using
	       essentially local conditions. PROMEGA has the ability 
	       (depending on the input parameters) to give results of higher
	       accuracy than PROAIM.  PROMEGA, however, is also much slower
	       than PROAIM and should therefore, be used in situations where
	       PROAIM fails to give results of sufficient accuracy or in
	       complicated systems where all ring and or cage critical
	       points are difficult to locate.

	       Please see the installation section in proaimv.man


BUBBLE.SRC   - BUBBLE finds critical points in the Laplacian of the electron
	       density, del-square-rho.


PROFIL.SRC   - A simple program which determines the value of either rho or
               del-square-rho along a user defined line in a molecule.


        THE FOLLOWING 7 PROGRAMS ARE GRAPHICS ROUTINES WHICH ARE DESCRIBED
        IN  GRAPHICS.TXT


GRDVEC.SRC   - GRDVEC calculates gradient paths in the electron density.

SCHUSS.SRC   - SCHUSS calculates a set of trajectories of the gradient field of                the electron density starting in a user specified plane of
               a molecule.  This is a vectorized version of GRDVEC. 

GRIDV.SRC    - GRIDV calculates values of rho or del-squared rho etc.
               for a grid of points in a user-specified plane.
               This is a vectorized version of old GRID.

CONTOR.SRC   - displays the grid of values from GRIDV in the form of a
               contour map.
 
RELIEF.SRC   - displays the grid of values from GRIDV in the form of
               a relief map.

CUBEV.SRC    - calculates values of rho or del-squared rho for a cube of 
               points. This a vectorized version of old CUBE.

ENVELOPE.SRC - displays output from CUBEV.
